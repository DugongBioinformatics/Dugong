    1.0 geWorkbench Installation Notes
===============================================================================

    System Requirements:
        Java:    
            The Java 7 JRE is required.  geWorkbench is distributed both with
            installers that include Java 7, as well as versions without.  Java
            can be downloaded from java.oracle.com. 

            Please note that Java 7 is also referred to as
            Java 1.7.  32-bit and 64-bit versions of Java can be used on
            appropriate platforms.
                 
            See http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads.
            
            geWorkbench will run using Java 8, but has not been tested
            extensively in that environment.  There are currently no known issues
            with using Java 8.
            
        Memory:  
             At least 4 GB of RAM is recommended when running with the 64-bit
             JRE7, which by default requests up to 2 GB of Java heap memory.
             With the 32-bit JRE7, the default maximum Java heap memory is 1 GB.
        
        Operating System:
            Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 (32 or 64-bit): no special requirements.
                 
            MacOSX:  Intel-based Mac running Mac OS X version 10.7.3 (Lion) or
            higher is required to install the Java 7 JRE.
                
            Linux: no special requirements known.

        Display Driver (affects PCA component 3D graph viewer only):
            When using a 64-bit JVM, the Java 3D library requires OpenGL
            version 1.2 or higher to be supported by your display driver.
      
    The Windows and Linux versions of geWorkbench provide an installation wizard
    (generated using InstallAnywhere).  The Mac OSX and generic versions are
    distributed as a simple zip file.  The generic release should run on any
    machine that supports Java 7.

    Additional installation details are provided below, and at
    www.geworkbench.org.  All user documentation is maintained 
    in online form at www.geworkbench.org.
    
    geWorkbench, unless otherwise noted for particular components, can be
    run on both 32 and 64-bit operating systems and JREs.  While the 64-bit
	version is preferred, the 32-bit versions can be used If physical memory
    is very limited.

    A few features of geWorkbench work only on 32-bit JREs, however, most have
    alternate presentations on 64-bit systems.  This affects primarily embedded
    display of web pages.  


    Platform-specific release details:

    1. Windows (XP/Vista/7/8/10)
    
        New with release 2.6.0, geWorkbench will now by default install to
        "C:\Program Files" system directory, e.g. to 
        C:\Program Files\geWorkbench_2.6.0.     

        File: geWorkbench_v2.6.0_Windows_JRE7_x64.exe  (recommended for
              64-bit versions of Windows)
              Includes the 64-bit Oracle Java 7 JRE update 71.

        File: geWorkbench_v2.6.0_Windows_JRE7_x86.exe (required for older
              32-bit OSs (e.g. Windows XP)).
              Includes the 32-bit Oracle Java 7 JRE update 71.

        File: geWorkbench_v2.6.0_Windows_noJRE.exe
              No JRE is included, you must make sure that an appropriate Java 7+
              JRE is installed on your system before installing geWorkbench.
              You may need to add Java to your path or set JAVA_HOME.

        Download and double-click the installer file to begin installation.


    2. MacOSX

        File: geWorkbench_v2.6.0_MacOSX_JRE7.zip.  (Requires Mac OSX 10.7.3 or
              higher).

        The MacOSX version of geWorkbench 2.6.0 is distributed as a simple zip
        file and includes the Java 7 update 71 JRE.  No installer is available
        for this release, instead, please follow the below steps.  

        Please carefully read and follow all of these instructions:

        1. Double-click on the downloaded file 
           "geWorkbench_v2.6.0_MacOSX_JRE7.zip" to expand it.

        2. Drag the extracted "geWorkbench_2.6.0" folder to a convenient 
           location, preferably the Applications folder.    

        3. The geWorkbench_2.6.0 folder contains launcher command files (e.g. 
           "launch_geworkbench_macosx_2G.command") which can be used to start
           geWorkbench with varying amounts of Java heap memory (2 GB in this
           example).  Launcher command files are available to start geWorkbench
           with 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 GB of maximum Java heap memory.  Choice of
           the Java heap memory size is discussed elsewhere in this document.
           2 GB is the recommended default value for geWorkbench 2.6.0 on
           64-bit systems such as Mac OSX.

           Right-click on the desired command file and select "Make Alias".

        4. Drag the new alias file e.g. to your Desktop for easy access.

        5. IMPORTANT (Gatekeeper function, MacOSX 10.7.3 and higher):
           The first time you attempt to start geWorkbench from one of
           the command files or an alias file, right-click on the
           file and select "Open".  You will be prompted as to whether you want to
           open this file from an unidentified developer; answer yes.  After this
           first time, on subsequent invocations you can start geWorkbench
           just by double-clicking on the alias or command file.


    3. Linux
       
        File: geWorkbench_v2.6.0_Linux_JRE7_x64.bin.
              Includes the 64-bit Oracle Java 7 JRE update 60.

        File: geWorkbench_v2.6.0_Linux_noJRE.bin
              No JRE is included, you must make sure that an appropriate Java 7+
              JRE is installed on your system before installing geWorkbench.
              You may need to configure the JRE. See the "Java_Environment
              Configuration" section of the geWorkbench Download and Installation
              page of www.geworkench.org.
   
   
        The Linux version of geWorkbench relies on X-Windows being installed
        and running. If you are running Linux on a server and e.g. Windows
        on your desktop, you will also need to run an X-windows server on
        your desktop machine. Further information can be found on the
        Download and Installation page of www.geworkench.org.

        After downloading, cd (if needed) to the directory to which you
        downloaded the installer.

        The following uses the example of the installer file with the JRE7.

        To begin the installation, type the command: 

              sh geWorkbench_v2.6.0_Linux_JRE7_x64.bin

        This will extract geWorkbench into a new directory called
        geWorkbench_2.6.0. 
  
        If you requested that a desktop link be created, it will be called
        geWorkbench_2.6.0 or rungeWorkbench_2.6.0 (if you create the shortcut
        in the same directory as the in which you extracted geWorkbench).

        To run geWorkbench, and assuming you are using the Linux bash shell,
        and that you created a shortcut link during installation,
        issue one of the following commands from your home directory
        (check the actual link name that was generated):  

              sh geWorkbench_2.6.0
                or
              sh rungeWorkbench_2.6.0.

         Alternatively, in the directory in which geWorkbench was installed,
         you can start geWorkbench with the command:
          
              sh geWorkbench


    4. Generic -   A non-installer-based version of
        geWorkbench is supplied in a Zip file which should work on
        any platform.

        File: geWorkbench_v2.6.0_Generic.zip

        Installation: 
    
             Unzip the file.  It will create a directory
                geWorkbench_2.6.0.
          

        Running geWorkbench (generic):

            You must have the Java 7+ JRE installed and the
               JRE must be in the path for geWorkbench.

            Windows: 
                Double click on the file
                "launch_geWorkbench.bat" to launch geWorkbench with
                its default Java heap memory setting, or double-click
                on one of the batch (.bat) files for specific sizes of
                Java heap memory.  The files can also be run from the
                command window.

            Mac OS X: 
                Double-click on one of the command (.command)
                files for specific sizes of Java heap memory.  The files
                can also be run from the command window.
            
            Linux/Unix:   
                Execute the script "launch_geworkbench.sh".
                          
            Any: Alternatively, if you have Apache Ant installed,
                 you can type "ant run" in the geWorkbench directory.

    2.0 - geWorkbench Introduction and History
===============================================================================

    geWorkBench, an open source bioinformatics platform 
    written in Java, makes sophisticated  tools for data management, 
    analysis and visualization available to the community in a 
    convenient fashion.
 
    geWorkbench evolved from a project, caWorkbench, which was originally
    sponsored by the National Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics
    (NCICB). Some of the most fully developed capabilities of the platform
    include microarray data analysis, regulatory network inference,
    sequence analysis, transcription factor binding site analysis,
    and pattern discovery.

    geWorkbench 2.6.0 (January 21, 2015)
    ====================================
    --- Summary ---
    geWorkbench 2.6.0 is a major release, including more than 70 bug
    fixes and other improvements to usability.  All users should immediately
    upgrade to 2.6.0.  Previous versions are no longer supported.

    -- Java 7 - With release 2.6.0, geWorkbench requires the Java 7 Runtime
    Environment (JRE).  Although no Java 7-specific code has yet been included,
    all testing is now done on 64-bit Java 7 and the code is compiled to Java 7
    bytecode. Windows and Linux versions of geWorkbench including the 64-bit
    JRE7 will be available; previously only 32-bit JREs were included. Use of
    the 64-bit JRE allows larger datasets to be loaded (through setting larger
    Java max heap sizes, described further below).

    Some legacy code was not compatible with Java 7 and those fixes are indicated
    below as "(Java 7)".

    -- Installation Directory - geWorkbench, while running, no longer writes any
    files to its own installation directory; all files are now written to temp
    areas in the user's directory space.  This allows geWorkbench to be
    installed in normal System directories, e.g. "Program Files" on Windows.

    -- Larger Java Heap Memory for larger datasets - geWorkbench is now
    available with 64-bit JREs for all platforms, with a default size of 2 GB
    for maximum Java heap memory.  Using the 64-bit JRE and larger Java heap
    sizes allows geWorkbench to work with much larger datasets.  Previous
    releases of geWorkbench used a default size of 1 GB for the maximum value
    of Java heap memory.  

    On machines with larger amounts of RAM, users can now easily start
    geWorkbench with even higher amounts of Java Heap memory simply by clicking
    on specific command files available in the geWorkbench installation
    root directory (currently for Windows and MacOSX only).  These files allow
    geWorkbench to be started with 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 GB specified as the maximum
    size of the Java heap memory.  The user should
    take care not to request more heap memory than there is physical RAM memory
    available, and also to allow at least 1-2 GB for the operating system.
    All heap sizes larger than 1 GB require use of a 64-bit JRE.

    The Windows launcher files end in .bat, while those for MacOSX end in
    .command, e.g. "launch_geworkbench_winpc_4G.bat" and 
    "launch_geworkbench_macosx_4G.command".  On either platform, the user can
    create shortcuts to the launcher files and place the shortcuts e.g. on the
    Desktop.

    -- BLAST - Among the more important fixes is a change to the BLAST component
    to comply with a new specification from NCBI (Mantis #3799) for BLAST job
    submissions.  After 12/1/2014 BLAST submissions may not work in previous
    releases of geWorkbench.

    -- R - Several problems are fixed in how R is used from geWorkbench.  Previous
    workarounds are no longer needed.  See details in bug reports below, especially
    with respect to SAM.  The user library setting for R packages in the geWorkbench
    Preferences component is now fully implemented and overrides any setting of
    the environment variable R_LIBS_USER.  This allows geWorkbench to use separate
    versions of a package (e.g. geWorkbench downloads a special version of Viper).

    -- GenomeSpace - integration with GenomeSpace is greatly improved.  GenomeSpace
    allows geWorkbench to exchange data with a number of other tools.  See fixes below.

    -- CART - The GenePattern 3.0 CART component is added.

    geWorkbench 2.5.0 (2013-10-10)
    ====================================
    --- Summary ---
    geWorkbench 2.5.0 is a major release.  It includes a simplification of the
    Workspace, removing the "Project" level of data organization.  The Marker
    Annotations component was completely reimplemented to use the bioDBNet data
    service rather than the discontinued caBIO service.  New parsing and
    display code was written so that all NCBI BLAST sequence alignments are now
    generated in geWorkbench from the BLAST results XML output file. This
    removes the dependency on specifics of the BLAST server HTML output.

    Several new components are added:  Consensus Clustering (GenePattern),
    LINCS_Query, VIPER, DeMAND and ceRNA.  Consensus Clustering uses multiple
    clustering runs to find consensus clusters and assess their stability.
    The LINCS Query component provides for query and display of computational
    and experimental results from the Columbia LINCS Center, which performs
    high-throughput drug candidate prediction and screening.  VIPER summarizes
    drug activity on gene expression profiles at the level of the transcription
    factors.  DeMAND is used to compute drug mechanism of action.  The ceRNA
    component provides query access to a database of precomputed competitive
    endogenous RNA (miRNA-mRNA) interactions for four different cancer types.

    The MARINa component has been separated from the MRA-FET version of Master
    Regulator Analysis. The "bar-code" graph first implemented in the MRA-FET
    Results Viewer component has now been adapted and added to the MARINa
    Results Viewer.  

    The Gene Ontology file (go-basic.obo) is now downloaded from the
    geneontology.org site using the new permanent URL and filename.

    The "Online Help" feature has been removed.  This material was identical
    to the geWorkbench tutorials, which are available at the geWorkbench.org
    website.

    geWorkbench 2.4.1 (2012-10-26)
    ====================================
    --- Summary ---
    geWorkbench v2.4.1 is a small but important bug-fix release, dealing with
    the BLAST and ANOVA components. Due to a change in the
    HTML output of the NCBI BLAST server, the BLAST component in  previous
    versions of geWorkbench no longer can parse and import BLAST results.
    In geWorkbench 2.4.1, a new parser using the BLAST XML result format has
    been implemented.  This greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the
    dependence on the BLAST HTML format result page.  However, future changes
    to the HTML page format should no longer affect the basic retrieval of
    results.  In addition, a problem was identified in the ANOVA component which
    caused incorrect markers to be used if a marker set was activated.
    
    These are the only changes in this release.
    
    
    --- Bug fixes ---
    Alignment results (BLAST)
      - 3186 - Implement XML parser due to NCBI HTML format changes.
    ANOVA
      - 3156 - Incorrect markers used if marker set activated.
    Installation
      - 3244 - Install on Macintosh will default to user home directory.
             
    
    
    geWorkbench 2.4.0 (2012-07-23)
    ====================================
    --- Summary ---
    geWorkbench v2.4.0 is a major release.  It adds one new component,
    "Significance Analysis of Microarrays(SAM)" and includes significant
    improvements to a second, Master Regulator Analyis.  It also adds the
    ability to accept annotation files for Affymetrix chips of types 
    "Human Gene 1.0 ST whole-transcript" and "Human Exon 1.0 ST".
    
    geWorkbench 2.4.0 can query the newly released 2.5.0 version of caArray.
    However, due to changes in the caArray client code, earlier versions of
    caArray can no longer be queried.
    
    The SkyBase component has been upgraded to allow access to a second and
    much larger database of homology models (PDB60), which currently has
    12,264 structures and 9,544,535 models.
    
    The t-test component now makes use of the Apache Commons Math Library.
    P-values may show slight changes due to improved precision in the
    calculation.
    
    Access to the local implementation of the IDEA algorithm has been removed
    due to problems found after its introduction in geWorkgbench 2.3.0.
    
    A large number of other improvements and bug fixes have been made and are
    described further below.

        All "Help" files were updated in the same way as described for
        changes to the tutorials.  In addition, three new chapters, derived
        from tutorials, were added.

    geWorkbench 2.3.0 (2012-03-16)
    ====================================
    --- Summary ---
    geWorkbench v2.3.0 is a major release.  It includes significant
    improvements in responsiveness and memory usage, and a streamlining of the
    graphical interface to make using analysis, filtering, normalization and
    visualization components much more easy.  
    
    Switching back and forth between large data nodes is now much faster.
    
    caArray downloads have been speeded up dramatically, and memory problems
    that limited the number of arrays that could be downloaded were solved.
    We have test-downloaded 527 arrays of type Affymetrix HT_HG-U133A in 16
    minutes with no memory problems.

    The analysis, filtering and visualization components are now reached
    through a right-click menu directly on the data node, or through the
    commands menu in the upper menu bar.  This allowed the removal of the
    dedicated "commands" area from the geWorkbench graphical interface, making
    much more room available for the display of results.
    
    Dynamic search for marker and gene names has been added to all filtering
    components.
    
    A number of data and result export options have been added.  Microarray
    data can now be exported to a tab-delimited file directly, or from the
    tabular viewer, allowing subsets of the data to be exported.
    
    Interactomes stored in the Cellular Network Knowledge Base can now be
    exported directly into the Project Folders component.
    
    A new component, IDEA (Interactome Dysregualtion Enrichment Analysis), is
    included.
    
    The GenePattern-based K-Means Clustering analysis was added in
    geWorkbench release 2.2.0 but was omitted from the release notes.  This is
    corrected in this copy.

    Full details of all changes are found below.


    --- New features and changes in release 2.3.0 ---

    Array Sets

      - #2828 - Interpret second column of array set CSV file as set names. 
    caArray
      - #2729 - Memory requirements during download were dramatically 
                decreased. More than 500 arrays have been downloaded with no
                adverse impact on memory usage. The previous limit was about
                100 arrays before memory was exhausted.

                returned by NCBI is fixed in 2.3.0. The number from column "N"
                was appearing after the score in the e-value column.
      - #2876 - Gap costs setting is removed for tblastx.
      - #2880 - In the results table, the number of identities rather than
                total aligned length was being reported under "align length". 
    caArray
      - #2769 - When more than one array is downloaded at a time, the arrays
                are automatically merged and the data node is given the name of
                the parent experiment. Previously, the name of each array was
                appended to create a very long data node name.
      - #2925 - Experiments are now referenced internally in the caArray
                interface code by their unique experiment ids, not by their
                names. There are experiments in caArray with duplicate names.

    geWorkbench 2.2.2 (2011-08-19)
    ====================================
    ---Summary---
    geWorkbench 2.2.2 is a bug fix release.  It corrects three issues
    with the Gene Ontology Analysis and Gene Ontology Viewer components.
    In certain circumstances after browsing the GO tree, if genes for a
    term were copied to a new Marker set, genes with no EntrezID were also
    copied. In the second issue, running GO analysis after restoring a saved
    workspace did not work.  In the third issue, creating a set of new
    markers from a GO term did not update pulldown menus properly, e.g.
    in the ARACNe hub selection pulldown.

    A new feature was added such that the list of arrays available for
    download from caArray ("remote" option on file open box) are presented
    in alphabetical order.

    The installation instructions for Windows 7 and Vista have been updated.
    As only users with administrative privileges on their machines can install
    to C:\, we are now recommending installation to the user's home directory.

    --- Changes/fixes in release 2.2.2 ---
    File Loading
     - #2705 - caArray array list searchability
    Gene Ontology
     - #2710 - GO tree browser returns additional markers
     - #2711 - Gene Ontology analysis fails after reloading workspace
     - #2713 - Marker set from GO does not appear in ARACNe Hub Markers box
               when selected
 
    There are no further changes included in this release.

    geWorkbench 2.2.1 (2011-07-29)
    ====================================
    ---Summary---
    geWorkbench 2.2.1 provides a number of improvements, especially as related
    to network import, display and export, sequence retrieval, and pattern
    discovery.  If a network is generated or loaded that may be to large to
    view in Cytocape, it can now instead by viewed as a text file.  The
    new "Fold Change" analysis component is included, which was to be released
    in version 2.2.0 but was omitted.  A new feature to overlay a t-test result
    onto a Cytoscape network, which was inadvertently disabled in release
    2.2.0, now works again.  The Gene Ontology analysis component now supports
    uses of  alternate ontology files (e.g. from the GO website).  Sequence
    retrieval for DNA sequences is now done using the UCSC refGene table, and
    is available for all organisms with genomes supported by UCSC.

    --- New features and changes in release 2.2.1---

    ANOVA
      - #2618 - Control buttons repositioned for easier use. 
      - #2694 - The simple range check as a test of whether data was
        log-normalized was removed.
    ARACNe
      - #2494 - Bonferroni correction option added. 
      - The "Choose edges with highest MI" option was renamed to "Merge
        multiple probesets".
      - #2648 - The adjacency matrix is no longer made symmetric. Each line now
        starts with a hub gene.
      - Similarly, the adjacency matrix, when saved to file, is not made
        symmetric.
      - #2679 - The "merge multiple probesets" option was not recorded in
        the dataset history.
      - Merging of multiple probesets is now just within a hub gene, not global.
      - #2684 - When a subset of markers was activated, the grid service
        version used an incorrect offset into the marker list.  
    BLAST
      - #2665 - Previous search results were not cleared if a following search
        returned no hits.
    Color Mosaic
      - #2401 - Export button and right-click menu - both now support export of
        significance results (p-values) from both t-test and ANOVA. 
    CNKB
      - Export of network adjacency matrix from Project Folder omitted
        gene/probeset names. 
    Cytoscape
      - t-test overlay on network did not work in release 2.2.0 due to a
        late change.  Fixed.
      - #2650 - Display all networks at the gene level.  When multiple
        probesets represent a gene in the network, the network will be
        summarized at the gene level.  As a result, the count of the number of
        nodes and edges displayed in Cytoscape may differ from the counts
        present in, e.g. a complete ARACNe adjacency matrix (ARACNe probeset
        merging option not used).
      - #2589, #2638 - If a network might be too large to view in Cytoscape,
        the user is offered an alternate visualization (text). The threshold
        for warning can be changed by the user. This replaces warnings that
        were previously built in to several components e.g. ARACNe. Now, an
        adjacency matrix is always created, regardless of size.
      - #2597, #2598, #2599 - Inconsistencies in how selected nodes in
        Cytoscape were reflected as markers in the Markers component were found
        and fixed. 
    File Open Dialog
      - #2698 - The "merge" checkbox is no longer disabled when a file type is
        selected which cannot be merged.  There were synchronization problems.
    Fold-Change Analysis
      - New component accidentally omitted from release 2.2.0.
    Network Import
      - Networks can now be imported either from Adjacency matrix files (#2432)
        or from SIF-format (#2434) files. The networks can be represented by
        gene symbols, Entrez IDs, or probeset names, or by some other identifier
        (#2432). Networks are represented in memory with the same identifiers
        that were imported. That is, if a network is read in using gene symbols,
        then it is represented at this level within geWorkbench. Probesets for
        each gene can be obtained as needed for particular analyses.
      - #2608, #2645 - On import, .SIF and .ADJ file extensions are
        automatically recognized.
      - On export, .ADJ is automatically added to file. 
    Gene Ontology Analysis
      - #2512 - The analysis now supports using an alternate annotation file
        rather than an Affymetrix annotation file. Organism annotation files
        from the geneontology.org website can now be used.
    GenSpace 
      - The J2EE framework used in geWorkbench 2.2.0 was replaced with one based
        on SOAP.
      - #2666 - The "Remove Friend" feature did not properly update the GUI.
    Marker Annotations
      - #2658 - a missing CGAP URL was added to the export file.
    MarkUs
      - #2622 - Added support for job description and email notification
        fields. 
    Master Regulator Analysis
      - #2610 - MRA can now be run from gene-level adjacency matrices created
        by CNKB.
      - #2301 - When saving results (target lists for MRs), a ".csv" file
        chooser is used and will append this extension automatically. 
    MINDy
      - #2659 - If MINDy was run remotely on the grid service, sorting on the
        modulators column of the results table did not work.
      - #2657 - The "All Markers" checkbox was removed, as its function has been

    - The GO Terms component is not included in this release.  It will
           return in a future release.
    - Fixed a problem (caused by a change in a server-side URL) with
        retrieving annotations for genes in Biocarta pathway diagrams (bug 1577).
    - The default caArray server was set to the production server at NCI
        (array.nci.nih.gov, port 8080) (bug 1602). The URL for the staging
      array was updated to array-stage.nci.nih.gov.
    - An incorrect argument was being sent to NCBI's BLAST server. Due to
        recent changes there implementing stricter checking, blastn would no
        longer run. (bug 1597).
    - Corrected a problem where, when using the adjusted Bonferroni correction,
        or the Westphal-Young with MaxT, only values with positive fold-changes
        were returned and displayed (bug 1603).
    - Added a feature whereby the user is warned before any operation that
        will alter the dataset, e.g. before filtering out markers, or before
        a log2 transformation.
    - Added a feature to allow adding a new empty marker set. This can then
        be used to receive markers selected interactively in Cytoscape (bug 1541).
    - Fixed a problem displaying patterns in the sequence viewer after running
        Pattern Discovery (SPLASH) (bug 1415).
    - Fixed a problem with displaying adjacency matrices generated by ARACNE
        in the Cytoscape component (bug 1449). 


    - Numerous changes were made to improve responsiveness, including when
          - selecting a marker in a large dataset (bug 1346),
          - right-clicking on Project with a large dataset (bug 1337),
          - saving a workspace (bug 1525), and
          - starting an analysis (bug 1544). 
     - Remaining changes, not listed here in detail, included
          - internal issues within geWorkbench,
          - improved verification of parameters and set selections before
            beginning a calculation,
          - improvements to the graphical user interfaces of many components, and
          - corrections to the grid implementations of analytical services
            (Hierarchical Clustering, SOM, ANOVA etc). 


    geWorkbench 1.5.1 (2008-09-23)
    ==================================== 
        -  It addresses changes in the APIs for the caArray and caBIO
           data services since geWorkbench 1.5 was released.  geWorkbench 1.5.1
           can currently connect with caArray 2.1 and caBIO 4.0/4.1.
        -  It also includes an update to parse the new release 26 of Affymetrix
           annotation files.
        -  Fixes a problem where annotation information was not associated with
           arrays that were merged.


    geWorkbench 1.5.0 (2008-07-03)
    ====================================
    ---New Modules---
          - ARACNE – gene network reverse engineering (from Andrea
              Califano's lab at Columbia University, 
              http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/califanolab/index.php/Software). 
          - ANOVA – Analysis of variance, ported from TIGR's MEV,
              http://www.tm4.org/mev.html). 
          - caArray2.0 connectivity – query for and download data from
              caArray 2.0 directly into geWorkbench.
          - Cellular Networks Knowledge Base – database of molecular 
              interactions.  (from Andrea Califano's lab at Columbia University, 
              http://amdec-bioinfo.cu-genome.org/html/BCellInteractome.html).
          - GenSpace - provide social networking capabilities and 
          allow you to connect with other geWorkbench users.
          - MatrixReduce – transcription factor binding site prediction
              (from Harmen Bussemaker's lab at Columbia University, 
              http://bussemaker.bio.columbia.edu/software/MatrixREDUCE/).
          - Analysis components ported from GenePattern (http://www.genepattern.org) 
              - Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
              - K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
              - Weighted Voting (WV)

    ---New File types supported---
           - The NCBI GEO series matrix file for microarray data (tab-delimited)

    ---New server side architecture---
           - Invocation of caGrid services is now delegated to an independent 
              component (the Dispatcher). This makes it possible to exit geWorkbench 
              after submitting a long-running job and then automatically pick up any 
              results next time the application starts. 

     ---Other changes---
          - The Marker and Array/Phenotypes components now support algebraic operations 
              (union, intersection, XOR) on marker and array groups.
          - Upon exiting the application, the user is prompted to store their workspace.
          - Workspace persistence problems have been resolved.
          - The Marker Annotations component has been enhanced in several ways:
              -- The integration with caBIO has been updated to use API Version 4.0
              -- The caBIO Pathway component (previously an independent geWorkbench 
                    component that would display BioCarta pathway images) has been 
                    integrated into the Marker Annotations component.
              -- Markers can be returned from BioCarta pathway diagrams.
              -- A new option is provided to choose between human or mouse CGAP 
                    annotation pages.


===============================================================================
    4.0 Known Issues/Defects
===============================================================================
   
    ---Running BLAST on multiple sequences---
        (Not seen recently) - The NCBI BLAST server may return an error when  multiple
        sequences are searched from geWorkbench.  The queries are sent serially,
        one at a time.   This appears to depend on the load on the
        NCIB BLAST server.
   
   
    ---Affymetrix Annotation files---

        Due to licensing restrictions, Affymetrix annotation files cannot be
        included in this distribution.  geWorkbench users who are working
        with Affymetrix chip data should retrieve the latest version of the
        appropriate annotation file for the chip type they using directly from
        Affymetrix.  geWorkbench uses the CSV format annotation files.

        Affymetrix annotation files can be downloaded from their support site,
        at www.affymetrix.com.  Although there are frequent changes to their website,
        the files can be found starting on the Support tab of the website:
        (1) the Technical Documentation section, e.g.:
            * Support->Affymetrix Microarray Solutions->Technical Documentation->Annotation Files 
        (2) Under "Support by Product".


        An example file from the Affymetrix site is
        "HG_U95Av2.na34.annot.csv.zip".  This file must be
        unzipped before use.  You can place the file in any convenient
        directory.  When you load a new data file, you will be asked
        for the location of the annotation file and can browse to it. 


    ---Grid Computations---
        The reference implementations of the server-side grid-enabled algorithms
        currently are running on a single front-end server not meant for
        heavy computational use.  That server is not configured for computing on large
        datasets or for long-running jobs.
